    "The line plot is a fairly common plot type that is used to plot the **trend of one numeric variable** against values of a second variable. In contrast to a scatterplot, where all data points are plotted, in a line plot, **only one point** is plotted for every unique x-value or bin of x-values (like a histogram). \n",

    "\n",
    "If the x-variable represents time, then a line plot of the data is frequently known as a `time series plot`. Often, we have only one observation per time period, like in stock or currency charts. While there is a **seaborn** function **`tsplot`** that is intended to be used with time series data, it is fairly specialized and (as of this writing's seaborn 0.8) is slated for major changes.\n",
