You don't want your visualization to shut out the 8% of the population that have some kind of color vision deficiency.

If you use a different, or custom palette, it might be worth checking your visualization's interpretability through a color blindness sim like this one.\n",

If points of different color on a qualitative scale overlap, the result may be a third color that cannot be matched to something in the palette. If multiple points on a quantitative scale overlap, then the result may be a value that does not actually exist in the data. To be safe here, avoid or minimize transparency in plots with color.
