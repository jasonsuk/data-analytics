For the ticks, we can use xticks to specify locations and labels in their natural units. Remember: we aren't changing the values taken by the data, only how they're displayed. Between integer powers of 10, we don't have clean values for even markings, but we can still get close. Setting ticks in cycles of 1-3-10 or 1-2-5-10 are very useful for base-10 log transforms."
